# Simple LUA Neovim
WIP! Always WIP!

Concept: Genuinely simple neovim config based around the new LUA integration. Must be able to really get work done in it without getting bogged down with broken plugins, startup delays, or other gotchas, which means it will also need to be cross-platform and integrate with VS-Code for quickly getting work done when there isn't time to set up a full environment.

# Set up
TBA

# TODOs
- TODO Investigate dropping Packer for more control and stability (particularly around what loads and when)
- TODO Incorporate DAP
